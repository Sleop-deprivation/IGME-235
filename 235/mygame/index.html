        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Octopath Traveler</i> is a single-player <abbr title="Japanese Role-Playing Game">JRPG</abbr> in which you control one of eight characters,
            each with a unique class, and guide them throughout their story. <br />On the way, you can find the rest of the characters, add them to your party, and play through
            their stories as well. It also features a graphical style combining <br />2D sprite art and 3D models known as "HD-2D", a deep battle system, and a very well-recieved
            soundtrack composed by Yasunori Nishiki.

        <h2>Review Excerpt</h2>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.cubed3.com/review/5001/1/octopath-traveler-nintendo-switch.html">
            The biggest difference between Octopath Traveler and other traditional JRPGs is the noticeable lack of a central narrative.
            While it's still a far cry from the<br />open worlds of many popular RPGs from the West,its freeform, open-ended storyline is
            definitely evocative of the storytelling methods used by that genre.<br />This gives the game a lot of room to set its own unique pace,
            and that almost always plays to its favour.
