    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <i>Dig Dug</i> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. <br />
        Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. <br />
        The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]

        This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs,"<br />
        or at least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.<br />
